## Fashion-Image-Multi-classification

### This project is focusing on an image recognition problem. It is a group project for the Applied Data Science course under Statistics Deparment of Columbia University. The group constructed a variety of machine learning models with the goal of generating predictive classifications.

### The Data
The MNIST Fashion database (https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) collected a large number of images for different types of apparel. Each image is divided into small squares called pixels of equal area. Within each pixel, a brightness measurement was recorded in grayscale. The brightness values range from 0 (white) to 255 (black). The original data set divided each image into 784 (28 by 28) pixels.
